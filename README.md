# The Kannji api-server running on hug
This is the second try of building an api-server for the Kannji app. Using Django caused a lot of overhead, so we searched for something new and found hug.

The api-specification is maintained at swaggerhub here: https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Jan-LucaKlees/Kannji/1.0.0

## Starting the development server
It is as simple as running the `start.sh` located in the `.docker/dev` dir.
